Email Redirect provides a way to bypass the default 'message sent' screen.

## Benefits:

Don't display the unsightly default screen, proceed directly to the 'return' page specified.

## Notes

Requires an edit to a core file 'mod.email.php', comment/delete the line `unset($_POST['RET']);`

## Changelog
